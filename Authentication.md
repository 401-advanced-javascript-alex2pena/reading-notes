# User Modeling
Some information, like emails, user names, and addresses can be stored in plain text, 
passwords should be encrypted using a hashing algorithm 
Storing data in a secure profile model keeps data private.

# Cryptography
Methods for encoding messages so that they can be read only by a person who knows the key

# Hash Algorithms
A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse. 
If identical data is passed into the algorithm the same hash will always be produced. Hash algorithms are often used for 
checking the integrity of data.

# Cypher Algorithms
A Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm takes a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data. 

# Basic Authorization
Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request.
